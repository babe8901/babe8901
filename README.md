I am currently an employee at Seclore Technologies Private Limited, Sakinaka, Mumbai. I am employed in the role of Product Engineer for last one year. I did my B.E in Computer Engineering at the Thakur College of Engineering and Technology in Mumbai. I love problem solving and have experience with C, C++, java, node, react, web development and python. I am currently looking for an internship opportunity suitable for my skills. I am efficient in back-end development and database connectivity and management. I have some skills in front-end development too.
